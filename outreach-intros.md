##Requesting a LinkedIn Introduction

Below is a sample outreach to a mutual connection via LinkedIn. Each section is numbered to help guide you in all areas you should hit on
* 1 - Start with the reason for your message
* 2 - Then state the reason for the meeting/introduction
* 3 - State you won't ask for a job
* 4 - Make request mutually benefical (if possible)
* 5 - Include your "Story"
* 6 - Give your 1st degree an out

1   “Hi John, I see that Susan Smith is in your first-degree network. I would very much appreciate an introduction to her for a 10 minute conversation.” 
 
2   “I noticed that Susan works in alumni relations at Ivy University. Over the long term, I’m very interested in making a move into higher education. I would welcome the opportunity to get Susan’s perspective on how the school is organized and where I might be able to add value down the road.”
 
3   “In the conversation I seek, I will not be asking Susan about job openings; Rather, I’m looking to gain her insight into Ivy and possibly other institutions of higher-ed.”
 
4   “I believe this meeting will be mutually beneficial. Given my many years of experience in fundraising, I could share with Susan some ideas that she may find useful for her efforts.”
 
5   “Susan may be interested to know that I have 10 years of experience in fundraising at non-profits, as is shown on my LinkedIn profile. During that time, I:
·       Met or exceeded every annual fundraising goal for the past 10 years
·       Planned and delivered dozens of successful events
 
6   “If you feel that it may not be appropriate to pass on this request, I totally understand. Regardless, I hope we stay in touch. Let me know if there’s anything I can do for you.”

### Consider contacting the person directly when

* Maybe you barely know the person in your network who can introduce you
* Less then steller confidence in how your first degree connection might represent you

In these cases, you may want to send an email directly to the person with a subject line "Our mutual shared connection on LinkedIn"

## Outreach to someone you met

Some things to keep in mind with writing this email is
* Use a meaningful subject line
The subject line should capture the recepient's interest and give them a reason to open it. Make it specific and add a personal touch. Some examples are "Great meeting you at the XYZ Meetup" or "I thought you would find this article (topic spoke on) interesting

Below is a sample outreach letter on followup with someone after a meeting
* 1 - Use their name and state how nice it was to meet them
* 2 - Reflect on a specific topic that was talked about in your meeting
* 3 - Ask for a followup (if needed)
* 4 - Close the conversation and thank them again

1   Hi John, It was nice meeting you at the career fair the other day. I really enjoyed our chat about your challenges finding the right candidates! I think I can help!
 
2   I read your article about the challenges that companies face when hiring sales reps and you mentioned a few things that really resonated with me. I was hoping that we could connect when you have a few minutes to chat about the specific sales role that you’re looking to fill and explore how I can help you with that challenge.
 
3   How does Wednesday at 10:00am or Thursday at 3:30pm work for you?
 
4   Thank you john and I look forward to your reply
       Best regards,
       Steve
