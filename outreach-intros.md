##Requesting a LinkedIn Request

Below is a sample outreach to a mutual connection via LinkedIn. Each section is numbered to help guide you in all areas you should hit on
* 1 - Start with the reason for your message
* 2 - Then state the reason for the meeting/introduction
* 3 - State you won't ask for a job
* 4 - Make request mutually benefical (if possible)
* 5 - Include your "Story"
* 6 - Give your 1st degree an out

1   “Hi John, I see that Susan Smith is in your first-degree network. I would very much appreciate an introduction to her for a 10 minute conversation.” 
 
2   “I noticed that Susan works in alumni relations at Ivy University. Over the long term, I’m very interested in making a move into higher education. I would welcome the opportunity to get Susan’s perspective on how the school is organized and where I might be able to add value down the road.”
 
3   “In the conversation I seek, I will not be asking Susan about job openings; Rather, I’m looking to gain her insight into Ivy and possibly other institutions of higher-ed.”
 
4   “I believe this meeting will be mutually beneficial. Given my many years of experience in fundraising, I could share with Susan some ideas that she may find useful for her efforts.”
 
5   “Susan may be interested to know that I have 10 years of experience in fundraising at non-profits, as is shown on my LinkedIn profile. During that time, I:
·       Met or exceeded every annual fundraising goal for the past 10 years
·       Planned and delivered dozens of successful events
 
6   “If you feel that it may not be appropriate to pass on this request, I totally understand. Regardless, I hope we stay in touch. Let me know if there’s anything I can do for you.”

### Consider contacting the person directly when

* Maybe you barely know the person in your network who can introduce you
* Less then steller confidence in how your first degree connection might represent you

In these cases, you may want to send an email directly to the person with a subject line "Our mutual shared connection on LinkedIn"

## Array Intersection
In ruby there's an array intersection operator. Try implementing it yourself using a brute force method with a time complexity of O(n^2), a method that uses hashes in unexpected ways with complexity of O(n) and a sorting solution with complexity of O(nlogn).

2.1.1 :009 > a = [ 1, 3, -4, 5, 6]; b = [2, 3, 4, 6, 77]
 => [2, 3, 4, 6, 77] 
2.1.1 :010 > a & b
 => [3, 6]

### group_by in Ruby Enumerable
In ruby there's a group_by method on Enumerable. Try implementing it yourself. Take some time to think on how to implement it. Don't worry if you can't recall the syntax for accepting blocks.

(1..6).group_by { |i| i%3 }
 => {0=>[3, 6], 1=>[1, 4], 2=>[2, 5]}
