#Peer Reviews
###Resume Review -
<p>In this exercise you'll have 20 minutes with your partner to review and give feedback on their resume. While reviewing, consider these questions:
<ul>
<li>Does the resume include the basic essentials discussed?</li>
<li>Does the resume encompass transferrable skills?</li>
<li>Is the resume one page for every ten years?</li>

Repeat this with your second pair.

Once you have completed two pair reviews for your resume, implement these changes.
