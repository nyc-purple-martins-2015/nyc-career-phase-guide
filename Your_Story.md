#What's Your Story
Being able to tell the story of your career transition is crucial to the success of your job search. 

Things to think about in preparing to tell your story:
<ul>
<li>Why now?</li>
<li>Why Dev?</li>
<li>What experiences are you bringing with you to the industry?</li>
<li>Who are you as a developer</li>
<li>What about your career journey is memorable?</li>
</ul>

In this exercise, you will craft:
<ul>
<li>A one sentence, high level introduction to who you are as a developer and career changer.</li>
<li>A three sentence introduction to who you are as a developer and career changer with a little more depth than the one sentence intro.</li>
<li>A three paragraph overview of who you are, how you got here, and your future ambitions as a developer and contributor to the tech workforce.</li>
</ul>

###How will these be used?
These introductions and overviews will be used in several different places. We'll be molding these to your resumes, LinkedIn profiles, cover letters, personal websites, and eventually we will learn how to turn these into two minute elevator pitches.

###Value Proposition
A more useful definition of value proposition is “a believable collection of the most persuasive reasons people should notice you and take the action you’re asking for.”

This way, it guides your decisions much more clearly and can be used as the basis for marketing messages.

If you don’t have a strong value proposition, people don’t have good reasons to do either of those.

For example, if your online bookstore has average selection, decent prices, delivery, a guarantee, good customer service, and a website, why would anyone buy from you? There’s surely a competitor who beats you in at least some of those aspects.

You don’t have to be the best in every way. Sure, it’s great if you are. But realistically, it’s difficult enough to be the best in one way.

However, if you’re the best in at least one way, you’re the best option for the people who value that aspect.

Apple doesn’t have the largest product selection. Amazon isn’t the most prestigious. Tiffany’s isn’t the cheapest.

People buy from them for other reasons.

So, if your bookstore has the largest selection, for example, but the other things are “just average,” the people who value a large selection have a reason to buy from you.

Something has to make you the best option for your target customers.

Otherwise, they have no good reason to buy what you’re selling.
