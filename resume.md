###Resume Must-Have's
* Header: Name, city, phone number, email, GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site (These should all be links)
* About Me: Your 1 - 3 sentence intro
* Skills: Highlight your dev skills first. Include any transferable skills in this section as well
* Personal Projects: What are you proud of? Show it off! Be sure projects are linked to visuals
* Experience: Lead with your position, then the company. Use dates! Add Dev Bootcamp under Experience.
* Education: This should be at the bottom. If you choose to add Dev Bootcamp, keep it short and sweet, such as: "19 week web development intensive program"

###Pro Tips:
* In the "About Me" section, consider how you want your dream company’s hiring manager to view you after reading this statem
* Do you have a big, bold opening line?
* Does it communicate who you are?
* Does it show what you do and how you got there?
* What is your big why statement?

###Buzzwords to Minimize:
* Responsible
* Expert
* Strategic
* Organizational
* Creative
* Driven
* Effective
* Innovative
* Patient
* Analytical
* Perfectionist

###Formatting Strategies
* Stick to one page
* Quantify as much as possible
* Be concise but descriptive
* Keep your formatting consistent
* Tailor each resume to the company or job
* Do not include references
