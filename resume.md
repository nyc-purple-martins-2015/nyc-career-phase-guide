###Resume Must-Have's
* Header: Name, city, phone number, email, GitHub, LinkedIn, personal site (These should all be links)
* Skills: Highlight your dev skills first. Include any transferable skills in this section as well
* Personal Projects: What are you proud of? Show it off! Be sure projects are linked to visuals
* Experience: Lead with your position, then the company. Use dates! Add Dev Bootcamp under Experience.
* Education: This should be at the bottom. If you choose to add Dev Bootcamp, keep it short and sweet, such as: "19 week web development intensive program"

###Buzzwords to Minimize:
* Responsible
* Expert
* Strategic
* Organizational
* Creative
* Driven
* Effective
